<h1>Description</h1>
<p>While sentiment analysis is a well-developed field, neural networks still have trouble identifying subtext or subtle emotional indicators. Without nonverbal cues typically privy to the human brain, such as a speakerâ€™s tone-of-voice or physical gestures, natural-language processors face the challenge of deriving the emotional meaning behind plaintext input. The premise of Natural Language Processing (NLP) rests on training computers to process the ever-evolving nuances of human language. If this field of research endeavors to move closer in unlocking the full capabilities of human communication, it must be trained in all distinct layers of natural language.<br>By the end of this project, our model would be able to correctly classify sentiment in data  from a variety of sources and topics.<br>We decided to choose datasets based on our goals to encourage robustness and diversity in our models.  Since the human vernacular differs across platforms and contexts, we saw it wise to include input from a variety of online social platforms. For this reason, we decided to use three different datasets, an IMDB movie ratings dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/imdb-movie-ratings-sentiment-analysis), a ChatGPT opinion dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charunisa/chatgpt-sentiment-analysis), and a social media dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdismielhossenabir/sentiment-analysis), all sourced from Kaggle, which were all preprocessed and combined to form one large dataset with close to 260-thousand data points.</p>
